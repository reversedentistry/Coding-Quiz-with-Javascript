# Building a Web Dev Quiz in the Browser Using Javascript

## Description 

How well do you know web development? Come test your knowledge with this multiple choice quiz and record your scores to see how you improve with each attempt. This quiz, which you can simply take in your browser,  is made functional mainly through Javascript. Upon starting, a timer will begin; if time runs out, the quiz ends even if you haven't finished all questions, and you will be presented with your final score based on the points you've gotten so far. During each question, immediately after selecting your answer, answers will be color-coded to let you know whether you selected the right option. If you select the right answer, you gain points. If you select the wrong answer, you will lose extra time on the timer.
